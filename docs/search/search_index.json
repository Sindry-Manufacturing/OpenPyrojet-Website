FAILURE TO DO SO WILL LIKELY RESULT IN DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH! Before you begin The carbides, nitrides and oxides are generally quite benign and inert even as micron powders. I do not recommend eating them, but they are essentially sand paper grit / drill bit / sawblade reinforcements. So they are quite safe in any quantity. Pure metals are the biggest real risk to handle and store in general. of the pure metals, zirconium, aluminum, titanium are probably the most reactive and toxic to human health if we are not discussing alkalis. Like lithium, sodium, potassium. Unless you are planning on printing batteries(which you could) we have no business with alkalis generally, due to their toxicity and explosion hazard. Titanium, aluminum, and zirconium are all highly flammable even at relatively large particle sizes, oxidize exothermically in air, and can self ignite when simply sitting on a shelf. They are an explosion hazard and potential neurotoxins when aerosolized(which they do readily due to their low specific density among metals). So under no circumstances should you breath or ingest them! Chrome is poisonous if inhaled and a known carcinogen. So stay away from it if at all possible. Nickel, iron, copper, Zinc, molybdenum, tungsten, and their alloys are generally benign and easy to handle, as long as one does not create dust clouds out of them. Anything containing silicon is relatively harmless, but can become an airborne silicate if it is very fine, which is essentially like inhaling asbestos. So try to stay away from silicon containing alloys. They have a lot of performance benefits for certain applications. and are really not that dangerous, since they tend to be heavy and difficult to aerosolize. But still. Best not to tango with them if you do not have to. DO NOT mess with beryllium or beryllia containing compounds unless you have no other choices. They are quite poisonous and can cause berylliosis, which makes mesothelioma look like a joke. Mercury is probably not available, but if it is, do not mess with it. It and its fumes (easily produced when it boils in a flame) will make you insane and kill you painfully. Zirconium, titanium and aluminum can be worked with, BUT they require significant care in handling. And splitting kilograms into gram quantities is probably not a safe thing to do without proper dust handling gear, a good respirator(effective for your specific particle size!), gloves, goggles(full face mask if possible) a smock, apron or lab coat rated for flame resistance, with tightly woven pores to resist infiltration and a shop equipped to deal with flammable metal powders(fume extractors, dust filters cyclonic collectors, zero spark low heat motors, anti static work surfaces and tubing etc. Basically everything required for working with gunpowder, solid rocket fuels or other hazardous materials). In general, unless it is absolutely necessary we prefer to try to derive the more reactive metals from their oxide counterparts, because their oxides are relatively benign, and can be converted to their pure metals via a reducing flame chemistry in the print head. (a fuel rich combustion mixture of air and fuel) This simple change of approach can eliminate a lot of cost and trouble in dealing with explosive powders. Basically all super alloys are relatively inert and safe to handle. Inconel, zirconel, stellite, hastealloy, monel, tribaloy, nichrome, kanthal, etc. Are all pretty benign and dense, so they do not aerosolize easily and have few biological effects besides typical metal fever from inhalation(DO NOT breathe it!). Not fun, and not recommended but not particularly deadly or long lasting. The probable (at the time of writing) lowest cost and lowest risk pure metal feedstocks are Iron, nickel, copper, molybdenum, and tungsten. virtually any oxide or carbide is easy to acquire and safe to handle. Most plastics are safe as well to handle as powders though they still can pose a dust explosion hazard is aerosolized as most powders do. In short DO NOT AEROSOLIZE THE POWDERS OUTSIDE OF THE PRINT HEAD! They should be pretty affordable(10-100 USD per kilogram), and allow us to do a variety of useful things, like making alloys, strong mechanical parts, and electronics. Additionally, noble metals, though very expensive, make for great feed stocks. Silver, gold and platinum are the \"gold standard\" for making dense, pure electrically conductive metal parts and tracks for electronic devices. They are also relatively benign, bioinert and non explosive thanks to their resistance to oxidation. Though their nanoparticle varieties can interact with one's genes in undesirable ways. DONT EAT THESE! Fuels Viable fuels for pyrojet can be just about any combustible substance than can flow through the print head. This includes generally, ethanol, Acetone, IPA, glycerol, gasoline, methanol, Nitromethane, paraffin, PLA, ABS, ASA, naptha, hexane, decane, motor and gear oil, WD-40,Kerosene, virtually any long chain hydrocarbon, combustible alcohol, alkene, alkane, or other fuel. These fuels are COMBUSTIBLE, and FLAMMABLE, this means that they can EXPLODE and seriously injure or kill the unwary, unwitting or fool hardy who disrespect or misuse them.

Further notes Our preferred feedstock materials are spherical particles between 1 and 50 microns in diameter. smaller and larger sizes will work to a point, but have a variety of complications around their tendency to settle and clog (for big particles) or to aggregate and clog (for very small particles). Our preferred fuel is either, Ethanol, methanol, naptha(white gas/coleman fuel), or common low octane unleaded gasoline. Additionally, the use of solutions of [metal salts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(chemistry) such as chlorides or sulphates in these fuels can be used to eliminate the need for metal powders if one is inclined to a more chemical solution and is having trouble with clogging and other issues witch plague pigment approaches. Metal salts allow for deposition of very thin films to very thick films with a great deal of variety in their structure and qualities depending on the specific deposition conditions and solution chemistry. This is still an active area of research. The reason we like white gas and ethanol best, is thanks to their high energy density, relatively benign combustion products, and fast, clean burning behavior. White gas is easier to ignite and burns hotter, and is easy to store and transport. Ethanol is common and very clean burning, though it has about half the energy density of white gas. So it will make for slower prints for most materials. Methanol/ethanol requires less oxygen for complete combuston however, and when mixed with an oxidizer such as nitromethane can approach the volumetric energy density of white gas, while producing much less coking(carbon soot) while being much less reactive with many metals.

Generation 0 is perhaps not deserving of a generation designation as it was assembled literally from garbage around the lab and a piece of sample material I acquired largely on a whim. I had been searching for cheaper more effective ways of making very high performance microheaters (small heating elements) capable of obtaining and maintaining temperatures in excess of 1300 K, starting from room temperature, in air, and doing so in ~1-10 milliseconds time scale, with power consumption that could be supplied by a commmon benchtop DC power supply, typicaly peak pulse powers no more than 50 watts. By taking two, 50mm square X 1mm thick aluminum oxide substrates, that had silver palladium traces screen printed onto them, in lines 0.25 mm wide X 0.15mm apart, and pinching a piece of silicon carbide monofilament between them I was able to demonstrate very responsive and white hot (>1300 K) temperature ramp of a few such silicon carbide segments bridging the leads on the aluminum oxide, by manually activating and deactivating a DC power supply. This was essentially when I(thought I) figured out how to build the heaters we would need to make pyrojet work, without a CMOS foundry or a clean room using commercially available off the shelf materials. All subsequent designs have derived a similar clamping filament mechanism as their core feature. this enables very high performance microheaters to be built, which can tolerate the conditions of combustion and detonation we would need for pyrojet to work. The thermal shock load the filament creates on the underlying ceramic substrate, results in their subsequent fracture after a small(10-100), somewhat unpredictable number of cycles, probably due to thermal fatigue stress cracking when the temperature gradient exceeds the thermal endurance of the material. Perhaps the use of quartz, enameled steel or LTCC substrates could overcome this limitation, but at great expense. I never found their performance to be much better personally. Further, other issues I encountered with ceramic substrates were their sensitivity to fracture under point loading, and the difficulty of actually clamping them in such a way that they would not fracture while pressing against the silicon carbide monofilament, which represents a relatively sharp, hard object and thus concentates clamping stesses at its small contact surface with the ceramic. A good starter on some of the issues with ceramic materials, despite their high temperature tolerance can be found in this paper on fracture in brittle materials Generation 1 Printheads A brief clip of gen 1 boiling water through its \"nozzle\", the little channel between the strips on the strip board...Also, flashing bright orange from a manually operated DC power supply. Generation 1 was an attempt to improve on and scale up the generation zero design by replacing my thumbs with a soft silicone pad and a pair of rigid aluminum heatsinks to hold the filament against a set of copper leads. the electrical connections were provided this time, by a piece of FR-2 strip board . FR-2 has better thermal mechanical endurance than ceramic materials by several orders of magnitude, and is far more insulating, which I hoped would improve the energy efficiency of the design, in spite of the much longer heaters, determined by the 0.5mm spacing between the copper strips on the strip board. Additionally, the FR-2, being a relatively compliant and flexible material made it much easier to establish consistent electrical connection to the silicon carbide monofilament. The relative flexibility of FR-2 allowed the electrical leads to compliantly adjust to the total clmaping force applied and establish connection to the monofilament heating element despite surface flaws or non flatness of the underlying assembly components. Additionally, FR-2, being composed typically of a material like Novolak , reinforced with matts of a fire retardant cotton essentially behaves like an apollo era heat shield material , in that, it pyrolyzes(oxidizes without ignition, and without supporting a flame of its own) and in doing so becomes more resistant to further pyrolysis, while retaining its underlying shape and structure. Generation 1 has a great deal in common with the design of thermal print heads . It may actually make for a very high performing, very low cost, and very long lasting such thermal printhead for some enterprising individual interested in exploring such a direction. Perhaps we here in the pyrojet project can generate a fork for addressing the need if there is interest in a well supported open source solution to thermal printing. A much improved version of the design could be quickly fabricated from FR-4 on aluminum, which would greatly reduce the dimensions, improve the speed, power consumption and resolution, and could eliminate many assembly steps from the original process. Discussion of this sort of thing is welcome in the discord. :) The big downfall of generation 1, was that it was too difficult to assemble as designed. Aligning all the parts repeatably, and ensuring levelness and flatness of the heating element across the width of the assembly was difficult. Further, the aluminum heatsinks are hugely overspecced for the actual peak pulse power and total dissipation. While extremely rigid, they added a great deal of unneccessary mass. Additionally, feeding material to the print head was diffcult, as the long, thin channels formed by the copper strip board were very small, and thus mostly relied on capillary action to carry water or fuel to the heating elements. Getting any particles into this would be very difficult, and designing a manifold of some kind to feed it proved quite complex. So I decided to move on to other designs, and try to simplify things. This print head design did teach me an important lesson, that FR-2 and FR-4 materials are far more durable than they are often given credit for. This was an important realization into generation 2 and beyond. I learned of an old adage that was new to me, \"If it can be done on FR-4, it should be done on FR-4\". I like to take good advice when I can find it. Generation 2 Printheads A short clip of gen 2 firing a nice big plume of flame. Generation 2 was a simplification from the lessons learned in generation 1. Especially taking advantage of the surprisingly good thermomechanical properties of FR-2 and FR-4. Additionally, I tried to reduce the amount of narrow channel a material feedstock solution/suspension would have to flow through to reach the heating elments by shortneing the overall assembly length and reducing the whole system to just a single heating element, and its copper leads, that is the minimum amount of strip board I needed to electrically connect to a piece of silicon carbide monofilament the width of two copper strips of the board. By reducing the overall amount of hardware required to assemble a print head, I greatly reduced the cost in terms of time and resources to make them for testing. Thus, I got to run a lot more experiments for far less effort invested. I also moved from big 6-32\" screws, to using M1 screws and nuts to clamp the strip boards together, because the holes in the strip board were the exact right size for M1 screws. How convenient! this elimnated the need for the aluminum heat sinks as well, as the FR-2 proved rigid enough to retain the filament reliably. With the elimination of the aluminum oxide sheet, also came the elimination of the need for the silicone pad to protect it, thus the assembly part count was reduced and the whole process was greatly simplified. With the use of only one heating element, the assembly process was easier to perform, and to ensure a flat and level heating element across a proportionately smaller length. The shorter channels, and the use of two strip boards instead of just one, allowed a slightly wider channel, thus flow through was improved... but only by a small amount. The problem of clogging and poor material flow did persist frustratingly. Still, this print head design taught me much about how to simplify assembly, the utility of small screws, and the value of small desktop CNC machines. the strip boards to make the generation 2 printhead were cut on the Saismart genmitsu 3018 desktop CNC mill. It is a very handy little device for custom FR-4 work and quick and dirty prototypes. This print head generation helped me appreciate the importance of oxygen in the combustion process at small scales. Because the heating element is practically in the open air, I believe it preheats the air in front of the exit of the channels on either side of the heating element, formed by the copper leads of the strip board, and as the fuel inside the channel vaporizes and sprays out of the exits on either side of the heating element, it meets hot air, and the hot surface of the element, and ignites. Of all the print head designs, this was the most impressive to look at up close, as the flame plumes it would produce were relatively large and bright. Additionally, this was the first generation to actually deposit any metal at all . Some of the earliest dots of silver printed by gen 2, on aluminum oxide substrates are shown below. The problem with having the heating element so close to the exterior of the printhead however, is that the external combustion is quite unconfined, and so produces more of a shotgun blast than a proper dot on a surface. It is more of a molten metal spray that spatters signifigantly beyond the width of the exit channel and heating element and is not always predictable in its geometry or distribution on the surface. This is probably not desirable for 3D printing applications. Though there may be reason to revisit gen2, with some refinements in the future. Perhaps there is something more to be learned from the more external combustion approach and the lessons in design and nozzle plate construction from gen 3, 3.1 and 4. Generation 2, expanded to inlcude a larger number of heating elements could also potentially be used to build thermal printheads on the cheap... Generation 3 Printheads A short clip of gen 3 firing with white gas (Naptha) and copper particles. In generation 3, I opted to try a planar geometry with an actual nozzle plate to try and better constrain the combustion of fuel and subsequent deposited spots. This time, I got better quality board stock, FR-4, instead of FR-2. FR-4 typically has much better chemical resistance, and much improved temperature resistance. Rather than burning and smoldering, FR-4 tends to lose mass as CO2 gas and forms a durable graphitic carbon layer which then inhibits further ingress of heat. Basically a cleaner version of the pyrolysis process in FR-2, but with the added durability of a E-glass , reinforcing phase instead of just paper or cotton fibers, and with a halogenated PMMA or Co-polyester matrix. Which greatly increases the specific heat and mechanical properties retention at elevated temperature, and reduces the thermal conductivity of the material beyond conventional novolak, or bakelite resins. These improvements greatly enhanced the durability and lifetime of the printheads in use. Soldifying the choice of FR-4 as a material in future print head designs. It is cheap, durable, and actually very heat and chemical resistant. An excellent middle ground in performance, and a minimum in cost between ceramics , polymers and glasses . In this design, I hyrbiized a few different choices from prior designs. Using a ST3-U standard FR-4 strip board for a electrical contact plate, a 1.27mm pitch perfboard for a nozzle plate, and the same M1 size self tapping screws from gen 2, and with a 3D printed PLA inlet manifold for connection to a syringe for feeding solutions and suspensions of fuel and particles and other feedstocks for testing. This version of the printhead took advantage of the fact that 1.27mm pitch is exactly half of 2.54mm pitch. this meant, that every other hole in the perf board, lined up with ever hole in the strip board, allowing for a screw to be inserted through both, whil leaving one hole between every pair of holes open on one end, and closed by the region between the strips of the strip board on the other. Effectively, this formed a combustion chamber, where fuel would enter from the sides, via two narrow channels, about as tall as the silicon carbide filament diameter (which was clamped between the perfboard and strip board to form the heating elments in each nozzle) at the top, and then when burned, would leave through the open end of the .635mm diameter via in the 1.27mm pitch perfboard. While this printhead turned out not to perform all that well for depositing metal, it jets liquids and fire from fuels quite effectively and probably represents one of the cheapest and simplest ways of building an inkjet style print head without the need for a CMOS foundry. If you are interested in this kind of technology, this may be of some service to you and may be a direction we look for forks of the project in the future. Inkjet technology really should be more accessible. It is very useful for a great many things, including multi jet powder bed fusion technologies , uv cured resin jetting , and a variety of other approaches which have largely been inhibited by the limitations of the availability and performance of well supported open source inkjet print head technologies. Prior open source projects, such as the Inkshield have suffered from similar limitations, that is, that the underlying limited performance and availability of printheads negatively impacted the scalability of the project. Though it produced some excellent results none the less, and some very useful basis knowledge for the operational theory of inkjet and inkjet like systems. The fully open source driver circuitry is also an excellent point of reference. Perhaps one could use generation 3's ability to spit plumes of concentrated flame reliably, when fed with ethanol and nitromethane or ethanol and glycerol, or white gas, to sinter powder in a powderbed directly and with precision comparable to a laser but fully in parallel? It is a thought I have considered but have not chosen to pursue due to the dangers and frustrations of open powder beds. It may be of some service to other enterprising individuals in the future. One imagines an inkjet like print head, shooting little gouts of ethanol torch flame to melt plastic,metal,and ceramic powder, at a tiny fraction of the cost of a laser, and with much greater speed thanks to the parallel multinozzle nature of an inkjet like print head. Some lessons learned from generation 3, is that perfboards allow far too much blowby, due to their large number of extraneous holes to be practical as nozzle plates for proper detonation spraying, when a detonation occurs in one nozzle, it disturbs the fuel in essentially all the surrounding ones, even several nozzles away! A complete nozzle plate, with holes only where they are needed, and with completely separate mounting holes is preferable. Also, better inter-nozzle sealing(a head gasket of sorts) is desirable, though still being worked on. Further, 3D printed PLA, is neither heat, nor chemical resistant enough to be part of a pyrojet printhead for any real extended use. Thus, with much help from Paul(basically all of the design work) and Ken(basically all of the software at the time) and some others, it was decided to make the next version, gen 3.1 via fabrication at JLPCB with all FR-4 components and soldered copper inlets and outlets for the manifold. For safety, and for quality. Generation 3.1 Printheads gen 3.1 Images of gen 3.1 can be found at the most recent assembly guide page on the website here. It demonstrated the superiority of an all FR-4 print head design, made by a professional board house, and the incredible time and cost savings such an operation enables if we can stick to more or less their standard feature and manufacturing limitation set. Paul and Ken were full of sound advice, and lent much of their skill and experience through the process. This print head taught us to minimize the number of fasteners, that the air gap, while important does not neccessarily have to be micrometric, and wasthe first print head to be tested with continuous flow loops by peristaltic pump and with other proper desktop printer integration elements. Generation 4 Printheads This is the most recent version, for which an assembly guide is not yet available. It integrates lessons from all the previous generations and will hopefully offer perfromance commensurate with such learning soon.

Generation 0 is perhaps not deserving of a generation designation as it was assembled literally from garbage around the lab and a piece of sample material I acquired largely on a whim. I had been searching for cheaper more effective ways of making very high performance microheaters (small heating elements) capable of obtaining and maintaining temperatures in excess of 1300 K, starting from room temperature, in air, and doing so in ~1-10 milliseconds time scale, with power consumption that could be supplied by a commmon benchtop DC power supply, typicaly peak pulse powers no more than 50 watts. By taking two, 50mm square X 1mm thick aluminum oxide substrates, that had silver palladium traces screen printed onto them, in lines 0.25 mm wide X 0.15mm apart, and pinching a piece of silicon carbide monofilament between them I was able to demonstrate very responsive and white hot (>1300 K) temperature ramp of a few such silicon carbide segments bridging the leads on the aluminum oxide, by manually activating and deactivating a DC power supply. This was essentially when I(thought I) figured out how to build the heaters we would need to make pyrojet work, without a CMOS foundry or a clean room using commercially available off the shelf materials. All subsequent designs have derived a similar clamping filament mechanism as their core feature. this enables very high performance microheaters to be built, which can tolerate the conditions of combustion and detonation we would need for pyrojet to work. The thermal shock load the filament creates on the underlying ceramic substrate, results in their subsequent fracture after a small(10-100), somewhat unpredictable number of cycles, probably due to thermal fatigue stress cracking when the temperature gradient exceeds the thermal endurance of the material. Perhaps the use of quartz, enameled steel or LTCC substrates could overcome this limitation, but at great expense. I never found their performance to be much better personally. Further, other issues I encountered with ceramic substrates were their sensitivity to fracture under point loading, and the difficulty of actually clamping them in such a way that they would not fracture while pressing against the silicon carbide monofilament, which represents a relatively sharp, hard object and thus concentates clamping stesses at its small contact surface with the ceramic. A good starter on some of the issues with ceramic materials, despite their high temperature tolerance can be found in this paper on fracture in brittle materials","title":"Generation 0 Printheads"},{"location":"history/#generation-1-printheads","text":"A brief clip of gen 1 boiling water through its \"nozzle\", the little channel between the strips on the strip board...Also, flashing bright orange from a manually operated DC power supply. Generation 1 was an attempt to improve on and scale up the generation zero design by replacing my thumbs with a soft silicone pad and a pair of rigid aluminum heatsinks to hold the filament against a set of copper leads. the electrical connections were provided this time, by a piece of FR-2 strip board . FR-2 has better thermal mechanical endurance than ceramic materials by several orders of magnitude, and is far more insulating, which I hoped would improve the energy efficiency of the design, in spite of the much longer heaters, determined by the 0.5mm spacing between the copper strips on the strip board. Additionally, the FR-2, being a relatively compliant and flexible material made it much easier to establish consistent electrical connection to the silicon carbide monofilament. The relative flexibility of FR-2 allowed the electrical leads to compliantly adjust to the total clmaping force applied and establish connection to the monofilament heating element despite surface flaws or non flatness of the underlying assembly components. Additionally, FR-2, being composed typically of a material like Novolak , reinforced with matts of a fire retardant cotton essentially behaves like an apollo era heat shield material , in that, it pyrolyzes(oxidizes without ignition, and without supporting a flame of its own) and in doing so becomes more resistant to further pyrolysis, while retaining its underlying shape and structure. Generation 1 has a great deal in common with the design of thermal print heads . It may actually make for a very high performing, very low cost, and very long lasting such thermal printhead for some enterprising individual interested in exploring such a direction. Perhaps we here in the pyrojet project can generate a fork for addressing the need if there is interest in a well supported open source solution to thermal printing. A much improved version of the design could be quickly fabricated from FR-4 on aluminum, which would greatly reduce the dimensions, improve the speed, power consumption and resolution, and could eliminate many assembly steps from the original process. Discussion of this sort of thing is welcome in the discord. :) The big downfall of generation 1, was that it was too difficult to assemble as designed. Aligning all the parts repeatably, and ensuring levelness and flatness of the heating element across the width of the assembly was difficult. Further, the aluminum heatsinks are hugely overspecced for the actual peak pulse power and total dissipation. While extremely rigid, they added a great deal of unneccessary mass. Additionally, feeding material to the print head was diffcult, as the long, thin channels formed by the copper strip board were very small, and thus mostly relied on capillary action to carry water or fuel to the heating elements. Getting any particles into this would be very difficult, and designing a manifold of some kind to feed it proved quite complex. So I decided to move on to other designs, and try to simplify things. This print head design did teach me an important lesson, that FR-2 and FR-4 materials are far more durable than they are often given credit for. This was an important realization into generation 2 and beyond. I learned of an old adage that was new to me, \"If it can be done on FR-4, it should be done on FR-4\". I like to take good advice when I can find it.","title":"Generation 1 Printheads"},{"location":"history/#generation-2-printheads","text":"A short clip of gen 2 firing a nice big plume of flame. Generation 2 was a simplification from the lessons learned in generation 1. Especially taking advantage of the surprisingly good thermomechanical properties of FR-2 and FR-4. Additionally, I tried to reduce the amount of narrow channel a material feedstock solution/suspension would have to flow through to reach the heating elments by shortneing the overall assembly length and reducing the whole system to just a single heating element, and its copper leads, that is the minimum amount of strip board I needed to electrically connect to a piece of silicon carbide monofilament the width of two copper strips of the board. By reducing the overall amount of hardware required to assemble a print head, I greatly reduced the cost in terms of time and resources to make them for testing. Thus, I got to run a lot more experiments for far less effort invested. I also moved from big 6-32\" screws, to using M1 screws and nuts to clamp the strip boards together, because the holes in the strip board were the exact right size for M1 screws. How convenient! this elimnated the need for the aluminum heat sinks as well, as the FR-2 proved rigid enough to retain the filament reliably. With the elimination of the aluminum oxide sheet, also came the elimination of the need for the silicone pad to protect it, thus the assembly part count was reduced and the whole process was greatly simplified. With the use of only one heating element, the assembly process was easier to perform, and to ensure a flat and level heating element across a proportionately smaller length. The shorter channels, and the use of two strip boards instead of just one, allowed a slightly wider channel, thus flow through was improved... but only by a small amount. The problem of clogging and poor material flow did persist frustratingly. Still, this print head design taught me much about how to simplify assembly, the utility of small screws, and the value of small desktop CNC machines. the strip boards to make the generation 2 printhead were cut on the Saismart genmitsu 3018 desktop CNC mill. It is a very handy little device for custom FR-4 work and quick and dirty prototypes. This print head generation helped me appreciate the importance of oxygen in the combustion process at small scales. Because the heating element is practically in the open air, I believe it preheats the air in front of the exit of the channels on either side of the heating element, formed by the copper leads of the strip board, and as the fuel inside the channel vaporizes and sprays out of the exits on either side of the heating element, it meets hot air, and the hot surface of the element, and ignites. Of all the print head designs, this was the most impressive to look at up close, as the flame plumes it would produce were relatively large and bright. Additionally, this was the first generation to actually deposit any metal at all . Some of the earliest dots of silver printed by gen 2, on aluminum oxide substrates are shown below. The problem with having the heating element so close to the exterior of the printhead however, is that the external combustion is quite unconfined, and so produces more of a shotgun blast than a proper dot on a surface. It is more of a molten metal spray that spatters signifigantly beyond the width of the exit channel and heating element and is not always predictable in its geometry or distribution on the surface. This is probably not desirable for 3D printing applications. Though there may be reason to revisit gen2, with some refinements in the future. Perhaps there is something more to be learned from the more external combustion approach and the lessons in design and nozzle plate construction from gen 3, 3.1 and 4. Generation 2, expanded to inlcude a larger number of heating elements could also potentially be used to build thermal printheads on the cheap...","title":"Generation 2 Printheads"},{"location":"history/#generation-3-printheads","text":"A short clip of gen 3 firing with white gas (Naptha) and copper particles. In generation 3, I opted to try a planar geometry with an actual nozzle plate to try and better constrain the combustion of fuel and subsequent deposited spots. This time, I got better quality board stock, FR-4, instead of FR-2. FR-4 typically has much better chemical resistance, and much improved temperature resistance. Rather than burning and smoldering, FR-4 tends to lose mass as CO2 gas and forms a durable graphitic carbon layer which then inhibits further ingress of heat. Basically a cleaner version of the pyrolysis process in FR-2, but with the added durability of a E-glass , reinforcing phase instead of just paper or cotton fibers, and with a halogenated PMMA or Co-polyester matrix. Which greatly increases the specific heat and mechanical properties retention at elevated temperature, and reduces the thermal conductivity of the material beyond conventional novolak, or bakelite resins. These improvements greatly enhanced the durability and lifetime of the printheads in use. Soldifying the choice of FR-4 as a material in future print head designs.

This is wonderful. However, the range, and properties of available plastics printable in a single process is limited, as is the potential for building functional end use components durable enough to be depended on for daily use in environments even as mild as hanging outside or in a car in the sun. Metal and ceramic 3D printing remain the domain of mega-corporations, the ultra wealthy, and Universities, and are in general considered to be fundamentally costly, dangerous and complex. In the case of consumer plastic printing, multi-material(plastic) capabilities are only recently becoming a reliable reality, and such capabilities for the industry are still challenging and expensive. On the whole, automating and closing the loop on the 3D printing process, is still in it's infancy. I deeply dislike this status quo,and have many applications I, as an individual, would like to use 3D printing for, for which plastics simply will not do the job. Fully automated, heterogeneous multi-material 3D printing of durable functional end use parts should be for everyone. Thus, Pyrojet. The story of Pyrojet is long and meandering, and still unfolding, so this is something of a living document, thus, it may change from time to time. So if you have arrived at this page looking for a quick skim, you are in for a troubling experience. If you have arrived here looking for some nice images and explanation regarding the design principles and operation of the various generations of Pyrojet printheads, you can find that starting with Generation 0 in the history section of this website, above. The Philosophical Bit I have(Michael/Unit-005), for most of my life been impelled with great force to resolve two critical problems of the human condition, these now become the philosophical drive to realize the Pyrojet project. The First, is the scarcity of durable individually useful goods and creative services (personally structured matter and energy, in a fundamental sense) in modern economies at the level of single individuals. The Second, the scarcity of time in human lives. I believe there are ,a growing number of, others driven to similar ends. These ends are critical to realizing a future of unlimited growth, and individual freedom through the elimination of physical and temporal resource scarcity that is simultaneously the driver of modern geopolitics, logistical supply chains, and highly unequitable distribution of wealth. If, accessible technologies can be made at low cost, be widely distributed, and address at least the first critical problem, while simultaneously expanding the capabilities of the individual to create useful and needed goods and services at a highly local level, then we could find ourselves living in a world no longer constrained by global logistics, and geopolitical resource struggle for scarce goods. Essentially a return to local cottage industry, but now technologically enhanced to the level of being able to replace industrial mass production with highly personalized, local manufacturing of all modern goods, and virtually any conceivable set of new designs, without limitations on their sophistication or quantity of production, and cost of acquisition comparable to mass production through the elimination of requisite skilled human input to the process. At a personal level, I have a need of sophisticated heterogeneous multi-material ceramic, metal and plastic parts for high performance electronics applications, particularly in high temperature, high pressure industrial process monitoring. At the present time, these devices are produced in small to medium quantities, made to order, by a dwindling number of skilled laborers using buildings full of heavy equipment from the 1950s and 60s, and materials from a limited number of increasingly uncooperative suppliers. This lends to their extremely high cost per part, and very long lead times of 2-6 months for a prototype to be built and tested, and leads of over a year for production to begin for many mission critical components. Similar such limitations exist in other industries, and in the private lives of many intrepid individuals. This is unacceptable. Pyrojet is built, at least initially, to address this problem. More fundamentally, the more control of matter and energy the individual has, the higher the average quality of life and the more diverse and varied human creativity can be. This is critical for human flourishing, and is thus, in my mind, imperative. The More Reasonable Bit Pyrojet is not a new technology. It is the combination of many old technologies that have not yet reached their full mature state. Pyrojet is not that fully mature state, but I believe it can be a critical step in that direction for, thermal spray, material jetting, 3D printing and several others. Essentially, an improved method of manipulating matter and energy at the microscale over macroscopic volumes to produce complex integrated goods with minimal human intervention. Pyrojet also represents a simplification of the above technologies into a cheap, compact and open source form that makes these historical dark arts, accesible, and can serve as a platform for further exploration and integration of the fundamental physics, chemistry and engineering behind such technologies, which has historically been slowed by industrial secrecy and anticompetitive practices. Such intergration and open, low cost exploration of the fundamentals is the same force that has made projects like Sci-Py and Num-Py , GNU/Linux , the early internet ,and other such projects wildly successful and critical to the infrastructure of modern science and technology. I aim to make pyrojet similarly utillitous. It is virtually impossible to place a market value on building a platform that creates new markets. Thus, the following section is likely to be grossly inaccurate. The Economic Bit I will consider just the problem I am most familiar with here, but it does not represent the only such opportunity for great change, that Pyrojet can and should address. It is ultimately up to you, the individual, how you use it, and how far you will take the technology to address unsolved problems. The Low Temperature Co-Fired Ceramics (LTCC) market has historically addressed government and commercial customers in telecom, process monitoring, downhole oil and gas sensing, generating turbine health monitoring, power electronic and microwave packaging, as well as more experimental MEMs and microfabrication endeavors. The benefits of high temperature tolerance, the flexibility of conventional PCB manufacturing, combined with the greatly enhanced thermal and electrical properties of ceramic and thick film with multiple layers and 3D heterogenous integration has enabling effects for placing long lifetime electronics in environments where conventional solutions simply wont survive, or will not be cost effective due to their lack of reliability under the conditions, or frequent replacements required due to wear and tear. Collectively the many niches addressed historically and still addressed today by LTCC, make up a market of some ~6.5 billion US dollars in size. Of far greater importance, is the fact that the reliability of the system being monitored can be a mission critical task. For example, in aerospace gas turbine engine health monitoring a very hot/cold and vibration prone environment, the reliability and current health status of a gas turbine engine literally has tens to hundreds of lives depending on it every time it flies . Under these circumstances, particularly where margins are as thin as in the airline industry, extremely accurate and reliable data about the health, and operational status of the engines, without requiring interruptions in operating service are neccessary, and must be provided at as low a cost basis as possible. While this is admittedly, not the most sexy application, I for one believe that reliable mission critical hardware should be as affordable, available and useful as possible, particularly where its function has lives depending on it. The antiquated processes and materials on which the production and operation of such LTCC health monitoring devices (essentially the only currently viable and qualified solution I might add) depends have begun to make sourcing these mission critical parts more and more difficult, and more and more costly. So much so that some airlines forgoe their use, and instead perform visual inspections and lifetime operational hours analysis, with detrimental effects on airline reliability, and the cost basis of flight due to increased maintenance hours and engine and components swaps too early and too late in the lifecycle of the machinery to effect the operational life of the assemblies involved. In short, it causes cut corners and cost increases for everyone, a deeply unpleasant no-win situation for all invovled. Given the importance of the outcomes these systems are critical to, I find the current operational status quo, and direction of the industry on which the production of these devices depend, to be unacceptable. I do not particularly enjoy the thought that obsolescence and economics take precedence over health and safety, or even just operational effectiveness of something as reliability sensistive as a gas turbine engine on a plane I may fly on! Thus, Pyrojet can and should solve this problem by replacing a building full of dwindling skilled labor and aging machinery, with a simple, affordable, and reliable device that fits on a desktop. No doubt, similar situations exist in many other areas of industry and personal life. I reiterate, it falls to you the individual user, to determine how far Pyrojet can reach, and what constructive and sustainable changes it can bring into the world as a tool for everyone.","title":"The Philosophy of Pyrojet"},{"location":"philosophy/#how-and-why-pyrojet-got-started","text":"3D printing today enables the virtually unlimited production of plastic parts at the individual level.

Metal and ceramic 3D printing remain the domain of mega-corporations, the ultra wealthy, and Universities, and are in general considered to be fundamentally costly, dangerous and complex. In the case of consumer plastic printing, multi-material(plastic) capabilities are only recently becoming a reliable reality, and such capabilities for the industry are still challenging and expensive. On the whole, automating and closing the loop on the 3D printing process, is still in it's infancy. I deeply dislike this status quo,and have many applications I, as an individual, would like to use 3D printing for, for which plastics simply will not do the job. Fully automated, heterogeneous multi-material 3D printing of durable functional end use parts should be for everyone. Thus, Pyrojet. The story of Pyrojet is long and meandering, and still unfolding, so this is something of a living document, thus, it may change from time to time. So if you have arrived at this page looking for a quick skim, you are in for a troubling experience. If you have arrived here looking for some nice images and explanation regarding the design principles and operation of the various generations of Pyrojet printheads, you can find that starting with Generation 0 in the history section of this website, above.","title":"How and Why Pyrojet Got Started"},{"location":"philosophy/#the-philosophical-bit","text":"I have(Michael/Unit-005), for most of my life been impelled with great force to resolve two critical problems of the human condition, these now become the philosophical drive to realize the Pyrojet project. The First, is the scarcity of durable individually useful goods and creative services (personally structured matter and energy, in a fundamental sense) in modern economies at the level of single individuals. The Second, the scarcity of time in human lives. I believe there are ,a growing number of, others driven to similar ends. These ends are critical to realizing a future of unlimited growth, and individual freedom through the elimination of physical and temporal resource scarcity that is simultaneously the driver of modern geopolitics, logistical supply chains, and highly unequitable distribution of wealth. If, accessible technologies can be made at low cost, be widely distributed, and address at least the first critical problem, while simultaneously expanding the capabilities of the individual to create useful and needed goods and services at a highly local level, then we could find ourselves living in a world no longer constrained by global logistics, and geopolitical resource struggle for scarce goods. Essentially a return to local cottage industry, but now technologically enhanced to the level of being able to replace industrial mass production with highly personalized, local manufacturing of all modern goods, and virtually any conceivable set of new designs, without limitations on their sophistication or quantity of production, and cost of acquisition comparable to mass production through the elimination of requisite skilled human input to the process. At a personal level, I have a need of sophisticated heterogeneous multi-material ceramic, metal and plastic parts for high performance electronics applications, particularly in high temperature, high pressure industrial process monitoring. At the present time, these devices are produced in small to medium quantities, made to order, by a dwindling number of skilled laborers using buildings full of heavy equipment from the 1950s and 60s, and materials from a limited number of increasingly uncooperative suppliers. This lends to their extremely high cost per part, and very long lead times of 2-6 months for a prototype to be built and tested, and leads of over a year for production to begin for many mission critical components. Similar such limitations exist in other industries, and in the private lives of many intrepid individuals. This is unacceptable. Pyrojet is built, at least initially, to address this problem. More fundamentally, the more control of matter and energy the individual has, the higher the average quality of life and the more diverse and varied human creativity can be. This is critical for human flourishing, and is thus, in my mind, imperative.","title":"The Philosophical Bit"},{"location":"philosophy/#the-more-reasonable-bit","text":"Pyrojet is not a new technology. It is the combination of many old technologies that have not yet reached their full mature state. Pyrojet is not that fully mature state, but I believe it can be a critical step in that direction for, thermal spray, material jetting, 3D printing and several others. Essentially, an improved method of manipulating matter and energy at the microscale over macroscopic volumes to produce complex integrated goods with minimal human intervention. Pyrojet also represents a simplification of the above technologies into a cheap, compact and open source form that makes these historical dark arts, accesible, and can serve as a platform for further exploration and integration of the fundamental physics, chemistry and engineering behind such technologies, which has historically been slowed by industrial secrecy and anticompetitive practices. Such intergration and open, low cost exploration of the fundamentals is the same force that has made projects like Sci-Py and Num-Py , GNU/Linux , the early internet ,and other such projects wildly successful and critical to the infrastructure of modern science and technology. I aim to make pyrojet similarly utillitous. It is virtually impossible to place a market value on building a platform that creates new markets. Thus, the following section is likely to be grossly inaccurate.","title":"The More Reasonable Bit"},{"location":"philosophy/#the-economic-bit","text":"I will consider just the problem I am most familiar with here, but it does not represent the only such opportunity for great change, that Pyrojet can and should address. It is ultimately up to you, the individual, how you use it, and how far you will take the technology to address unsolved problems. The Low Temperature Co-Fired Ceramics (LTCC) market has historically addressed government and commercial customers in telecom, process monitoring, downhole oil and gas sensing, generating turbine health monitoring, power electronic and microwave packaging, as well as more experimental MEMs and microfabrication endeavors. The benefits of high temperature tolerance, the flexibility of conventional PCB manufacturing, combined with the greatly enhanced thermal and electrical properties of ceramic and thick film with multiple layers and 3D heterogenous integration has enabling effects for placing long lifetime electronics in environments where conventional solutions simply wont survive, or will not be cost effective due to their lack of reliability under the conditions, or frequent replacements required due to wear and tear. Collectively the many niches addressed historically and still addressed today by LTCC, make up a market of some ~6.5 billion US dollars in size. Of far greater importance, is the fact that the reliability of the system being monitored can be a mission critical task. For example, in aerospace gas turbine engine health monitoring a very hot/cold and vibration prone environment, the reliability and current health status of a gas turbine engine literally has tens to hundreds of lives depending on it every time it flies . Under these circumstances, particularly where margins are as thin as in the airline industry, extremely accurate and reliable data about the health, and operational status of the engines, without requiring interruptions in operating service are neccessary, and must be provided at as low a cost basis as possible. While this is admittedly, not the most sexy application, I for one believe that reliable mission critical hardware should be as affordable, available and useful as possible, particularly where its function has lives depending on it. The antiquated processes and materials on which the production and operation of such LTCC health monitoring devices (essentially the only currently viable and qualified solution I might add) depends have begun to make sourcing these mission critical parts more and more difficult, and more and more costly. So much so that some airlines forgoe their use, and instead perform visual inspections and lifetime operational hours analysis, with detrimental effects on airline reliability, and the cost basis of flight due to increased maintenance hours and engine and components swaps too early and too late in the lifecycle of the machinery to effect the operational life of the assemblies involved. In short, it causes cut corners and cost increases for everyone, a deeply unpleasant no-win situation for all invovled. Given the importance of the outcomes these systems are critical to, I find the current operational status quo, and direction of the industry on which the production of these devices depend, to be unacceptable. I do not particularly enjoy the thought that obsolescence and economics take precedence over health and safety, or even just operational effectiveness of something as reliability sensistive as a gas turbine engine on a plane I may fly on! Thus, Pyrojet can and should solve this problem by replacing a building full of dwindling skilled labor and aging machinery, with a simple, affordable, and reliable device that fits on a desktop. No doubt, similar situations exist in many other areas of industry and personal life. I reiterate, it falls to you the individual user, to determine how far Pyrojet can reach, and what constructive and sustainable changes it can bring into the world as a tool for everyone.","title":"The Economic Bit"},{"location":"project-brief/","text":"Project Brief The current objective of OpenPyrojet, is to create the first generation open source and open hardware thermal spraying 3D printer. By using affordable, accessible and readily available parts and materials, we will create a new breed of 3D printer, that enables the heterogenous additive manufacturing of metal, plastic and ceramic monoliths rapidly, precisely, autonomously and at relatively low cost(in terms of time and money) to the user compared to contemporary 3D printing solutions. Current Market We believe this to be possible, due to the convergence of several co-factors in the present day(2022). In particular, the incredible decline in cost and complexity of autonomous CNC and robotic components, in terms of control and actuation, as well as the wide availability of good quality standard structural elements, the decreasing cost of refractory materials in favorble form factors, the wide availability of energy dense fuel products, and the increasing availability and declining cost of particulate material feedstocks. Additionally, the need for low cost, autonomous and widely accessible electronics prototyping and manufacturing processes, that improve on the user experience and the overall dirty dull and dangerous state of the art in electronics manufacturing are highly desirable to many parties beyond just we the developers. Current 3D printing approaches are largely ineffective in terms of cost and time for generating high quality, looks like, feels like, and works like, electronic parts, we believe this represents a substantial opportunity to create change in electronics manufacturing and prototyping, and eventually in the whole of manufacturing as a concept through the introduction of relatively low cost, autonomous, high speed, high precision 3D printing of metals, plastics and ceramics. We also aim to eventually bring totally custom, free open and autonomous, on demand manufacturing, to the consumer desktop, or at least to the community scale, facilitating a return to the flexible and local cottage industries of the past, now cybernetically enhanced with the ability to create with the speed and quality of autonomous mass production assembly lines, and accelerated by the computerization and networked intelligence of the modern internet. Goal Outline We believe we can accomplish these lofty goals by hybridizing thermal inkjet printing and thermal spray tehnologies into a compact, self contained, open source 3D printer print head assembly and material feedstock handling system integrable with mass market consumer 3D printer control boards and robotic motion systems such as the Ender 3, the Prusa mk3s and mini, and others. How we'll achieve it The basic system concept is thus: Fuel and material are held in a reservoir, kept mixed and pumped in and out by a syringe pump. This pump pushes fuel, and suspended material particles to the print head from the back through perfboard(of which the print head is made) holes. The fuel and material mixture circulate over the top of the print head at a constant average velocity to produce a negative pressure and prevent settling of the materials suspended in the fuel. When the time comes to deposit material on the build plate, a short voltage pulse of controlled amplitude is applied to the captive heater wire, across two adjacent plated through vias in the perfboard. This causes the wire to rapidly(with in 1-10 milliseconds) heat up, vaporizing the fuel and entraining the suspended material. Once an appropriate volume of fuel and material has been vaporized into the nozzle, a second, larger amplitude voltage pulse is applied, raising the temperature in the nozzle to the autoignition temperature of the fuel/air mixture in the nozzle. This ignites the fuel-air mixture, and melts and accelerates the material to deposit it on the build plate. Thusly, can we deposit virtually any material known, heterogeneously, autonomously with nearly complete closed loop control of the mass and energy flows of the process. Control is achieved by continuously performing 3 simultaneous measurement techniques, namely, differential scanning calorimetry(DSC), Surface enhanced IR spectroscopy(IRSPEC), and cyclcic voltammetry(CV). The first technique(DSC) is done by continuously monitoring the relationship between temperature, and power of the heating element throughout the deposition process. By tracking changes in the power applied to the element to maintain a given temperature across the whole temperature ramp during deposition, we can spot phase changes, ignition, deflagration and combustion, and continuously monitor the health and efficiency of the deposition process in each nozzle during each discrete deposition event. The second technique (IRSPEC) is done by continuously monitoring the short time scale photocurrents induced in the element by the emitted and reflected IR-photons(heat related light) from the combustion of the fuel, the melting and cooling of the feed stock material and from the various surfaces effected during deposition. This allows us to monitor the chemical composition of the involved surfaces in real time, and to get a handle on the specific bonding events taking place to allow tuning and monitoring of interface growth and quality during deposition. The third technique(CV) is done by providing a controlled input voltage waveform, and continuously monitoring changes in the response current of the heating element and adjoining electrical contacts. In this way we can detect electrochemical events and manipulate the electrochemistry of the combustion, and gaseous phases in the vicinity of the deposition process, in particular, oxidation events, reduction events, partial combustion, coking, etc.","title":"Project Brief"},{"location":"project-brief/#project-brief","text":"The current objective of OpenPyrojet, is to create the first generation open source and open hardware thermal spraying 3D printer.

Take note of our safety guidelines, but don't consider them comprehensive or complete. This page shows you how the Gen 3.1 print head prototype was assembled. This is what the finished print head looks like: To build a strong print head, multiple layers made from PCBs are used. These layers are stacked in the order as they are laid out below: First, the inlet and outlet are prepared. To connect Viton tubing to the print head, small copper pipes ( 3 mm diameter) are soldered to the PCB. The picture shows a larger copper pipe, because the wrong size was used when taking pictures: Solder was applied to the pads first: Initially, the solder doesn't want to connect neatly all around the copper pipe. The picture below shows the result of that. Some extra solder was used and placed on such locations. Flux would've probably helped too. Smudges are another problem that might occur while soldering. It cleaned it off by wiping the (cleaned) soldering iron on it. It's not problematic if there is some solder on the side, but I have to make sure it's not sharp. That way, it won't cut the Viton tubing later on: Finally, there is a neat collar on the copper pipe: The next step is to put the monofilament on one of the PCB layers. This monofilament is what heats up the fuel, which causes the fuel to eject through the nozzle. The filament gets sandwiched between the nozzle PCB and the PCB that holds the connector. The filament can be stored in a folded sheet of paper: The filament is cut to size. It's good to make it as wide as possible, so it's easier to control and so that we can tape it down on the sides. Combining the PCBs is tricky, because the filament won't lay still on a flat surface. In the picture, glue is used to keep the filament in place. In the future, a piece of tape (e.g. Kapton tape) will be a better alternative. The nozzle PCB layer had holes that were too small in diameter. They were widened them by hand with some cheap drills, slowly increasing the diameter 0.1 mm at a time: A single row of screws combine the two PCB layers. They are not tightened yet: Tightening is done carefully and as evenly as possible. When everything stops sliding around, resistance measurements are done before continueing to tighten further. The resistance measurements are repeated until the values are in an acceptable range. The nozzle plate should be placed straigth, unlike in the picture below. In the future, a 3D printable guide will be developed to combine the 2 PCBs with proper alignment. The prepared PCBs are ready to be combined. I took 8 pieces of M2 x 10mm and some M2 nuts to match.

There is a risk of hurting yourself and/or damaging property when trying to implement or replicate the hardware and/or software. Doing so is completely at your own risk. Take note of our safety guidelines, but don't consider them comprehensive or complete. Getting Started This section is a visual guide to assembling a 48 DPI (~500 micron dot size) 8 nozzle pyrojetprint head, using nothing but off the shelf parts and basic hand tools. The specifications of the finished print head are thus: 8 channels, 4 anodes, 4 cathodes heater room temperature resistances(RTR) between 10-100 Ohms, generally clustering around 20-50 ohms Negative temperature coefficient of resistance (NTCR) of ~5.2E-4 Ohm / K maximum pulse energy tolerance of 1.2 joules, maximum drive voltage, 50 Volts, maximum drive current 500 milliamps. Element is intended to ramp from room temperature to 1900 K in <= 10 milliseconds. Heating element material: graphite carbon core Silicon carbide CVD monofilament, 0.135 mm diameter. 0.03mm carbon core diameter. Resistivity of 0.05 Ohm * cm, 2E-4 Ohm * m. Board and manifold material : FR4 glass epoxy prepreg board with copper-nickel plated through holes. Inlet and electrical lead side 2.54 millimeter pitch with 1.2mm diameter holes, 2.0 mm wide square pad contacts concentric to holes. Nozzle plate, round 0.635mm diameter holes on 1.27mm pitch, secured to 2.54 mm pitch board with self tapping m1.2 black oxide screws. Print head must support capacitive touch sensing, temperature monitoring of the heating elements, and IV signal monitoring in the nozzles. Should be cheap, costing less than 2 USD / printhead. needs to be scalable to large numbers of nozzles over a large area, and to small feature sizes (small nozzle and heater widths) and thus high cycling frequencies. Should be designed to minimize heat loss from the heating element, and from the combustion in the nozzles, this prevents flame quenching and excessive power consumption as we scale down feature size. Scope Before you get started you should know that this document is only for the most basic of print heads obtainable with off the shelf parts and materials. This is intended as a very simple first step into the pyrojet project, and towards building your own pyrojet printer. You will require a few basic hand tools, such as a hack saw and precision screw driver. The materials for the print head can be a bit odd to source, such as FR4 plated through hole perf boards on 1.27mm pitch, and the of course the silicon carbide monofilament that is the heating element. Unfortunately, it is one of the vey few materials, commercially available that can do the job and do it well. Other heating element materials, such as graphite, kanthal, nichrome, platinum, stainless steel, generally do not have high enough resistance to attain the thermal ramp speed required of the heating element, and/or lack the oxidation resistance, hot creep strength and high melting point (>3100 K ) required to survive repeated exposure to stoichiometric hydrocarbon combustion and molten metal particles.. If you do find another material better suited and more widely available (some kind of oxygen resistant graphite? maybe tungsten carbide? Zriconia wire? Molybdenum disillicide wire?) do not hesitate to make it known and use it! Graphical Assembly Guide Step 1: Preparing the backplane Cut out a piece of the 2.54mm pitch PCB. You could use a bandsaw, keyhole saw, jewelers saw, or other implements. There are many kinds of perfboard available. Square pads are less common but do exist, and help greatly in alignment in later steps. Mill/saw out a rectangular piece of the 2.54mm perfboard, 11 holes long, by 5 holes wide. Approximately, 29 mm long, by 15 mm wide. Try to keep your cuts as straight as possible. The backplane will have rough edges and may require sanding or lapping. You can use fine grit sand paper and side cutters or a razor blade to trim the rough edges, or simply smooth it down against a piece of ceramic, like aluminum oxide sheets as shown below. Lap the rough cut edges of the back plane to make sure it will fit nicely on the nozzle plate. Be sure to dunk the backplane 99% IPA or a similar cleaning agent to remove dust and oil after lapping. For the next step, grab a fine point sharpie, and 1.27mm pitch perfboard(for nozzle plate), and align the holes in the 2.54mm backplane with holes in the 1.27mm perfboard. Make sure there is some margin in the 1.27mm perfboard around your aligned 2.54mm backplane. Place the freshly cut, lapped and cleaned backplane onto the 1.27mm pitch perfboard, aligning the holes of each board. Mark the position with a fine point sharpie, and mark the location of the heater row on the nozzle plate as well. Step 2: Installing The Heating Element Once you have the location marked and the backplane aligned and resting on the nozzle plate, get your silicon carbide monofilament of choice. Mine is a specialty materials, SCS-6 standard 0.135mm carbon core 3C, beta silicon carbide CVD derived monofilament. Remove the backplane from the nozzle plate and prepare to align a piece of the filament with the row you marked on the nozzle plate previously to denote where your center row (heater row) is located. Just above where you made your heater row mark, place a piece of Kapton tape, being careful not to cover the row of holes in the 1.27mm perfboard where your heater row goes. Place another piece of Kapton along the bottom edge of the 1.27mm perfboard, just below your heater row mark as shown, to secure the nozzle plate to your work surface and provide alignment of the filament as well as preload between the nozzle plate and the backplane. Lay the silicon carbide monofilament along the heater row as shown, between the pieces of Kapton tape. Secure the filament to the 1.27mm pitch perfboard nozzle plate and across the heater row with Kapton tape, perpendicular to the other two pieces of Kapton as shown. Step 3: Installing The Backplane And Clamping The Heating Element Find your M1.2X3mm self tapping screws and precision screw driver\u2026 Lay your backplane gently across your now tapped down silicon carbide monofilament heating element, being sure to align every other hole in the nozzle plate, with each hole in the backplane, and extract a M1.2 X 3mm self tapping screw from the box. Firmly press and screw the m1.2 X 3mm screw into one one of the aligned holes, preferable one at the far left corner of the backplane closest to the edge. It should bite and screw in easily. Tighten it until it is firm and snug, and resists further turning. But no tighter. Repeat this fastening process, being careful to stagger the screws and install them adjacent to the heater row, so that no two are on the same column. This will make soldering easier later, and ensures a uniform clamping force on the heating element which provide consistent electrical and thermal contact. Set your multimeter to the 200 Ohm setting, and probe each pair of adjacent contacts along the heater row on the now secured backplane. Go back and tighten the screws until all the heater resistances read between 10 and 100 ohms. If all your screws are tightened evenly, all the resistances should cluster between 20 and 50 ohms. Optimal resistance for the heaters in this design is 22 Ohms. Step 4: Releasing The Printhead You may now use your hack saw, or mill to carefully release the print head assembly from the nozzle plate stock, if you did not cut the nozzle plate out separately\u2026 This will be done by cutting flat through the surface of the 1.27 mm perfboard stock as shown\u2026 Cutting through the 1.27mm perfboard is quite tough. It takes some patience and a sturdy work surface. A clamp or other work piece holder can help, though it is possible to perform the release entirely by hand. You may find that pieces of the nozzle plate stock 1.27mm perfboard break off as you saw through it. Stop once you can see the 2.54 mm perfboard back plane showing. Be sure to leave the 2.54 mm perfboard excess material around the nozzle plate, to use as a flange for later. After perhaps 10 minutes of steady work, you should end up with something like what you see in this image of the released print head. Each active nozzle (every other hole in the 1.27 mm perfboard nozzle plate) is ~0.635 mm in diameter and ~1.6 mm deep. Each is plated with copper and nickel which serves as a thermal barrier coating. Take note of the heater and nozzle locations. Each heater formed by the contacts of the 2.54 mm pitch perfboard pressing against the silicon carbide monofilament, create heaters that are cylindrical and have dimensions of ~0.5mm long X 0.135mm diameter. Step 5: Packaging and Back Contacts Soldering Once you have your completed print head chip, and have identified the back contact locations, grab a set of 9, separately colored 0.1\u201d jumper pins, and leave them glued together to make a homemade color coded ribbon cable. Use a pair of needle nose pliers to bend the pins, at one end of your \u201cribbon cable\u201d to 90 degree \u201cL\u201d shapes. Alternatively, you may create solder jumpers across the contacts of the backplane on it's backside. Solder the freshly bent \u201cL\u201d shaped jumper pin ends of the ribbon cable to the back contacts (the 2.54mm pitch perfboard plated holes we identified earlier in slide 27 and 28). This could take some time, it is a tight job, and can be frustrating. Take your time, take breaks and try not to breath too much solder. A fine tip soldering iron, and some fine solder wire helps. When finished your jumpers should have their insulated black thermoplastic end covers inside the perimeter of the print head back plane. Like the image to the right otherwise it may not fit into the reservoir and package very well\u2026 The last step is to coat the edges of the print head chip in a two part epoxy or superglue, and press it into the hole in the bottom of the 3D printed reservoir and creality ender 3 compatible package. Be careful not to get the epoxy up onto the nozzle plate, and try to keep it on the flange of the backplane as much as possible. Here are some short clips of the printhead actually firing, fueled by naptha(white gas/coleman gas) and about 23 watts of peak electrical pulse energy , @ 31 Volts, 0.75 A .

Board and manifold material : FR4 glass epoxy prepreg board with copper-nickel plated through holes. Inlet and electrical lead side 2.54 millimeter pitch with 1.2mm diameter holes, 2.0 mm wide square pad contacts concentric to holes. Nozzle plate, round 0.635mm diameter holes on 1.27mm pitch, secured to 2.54 mm pitch board with self tapping m1.2 black oxide screws. Print head must support capacitive touch sensing, temperature monitoring of the heating elements, and IV signal monitoring in the nozzles. Should be cheap, costing less than 2 USD / printhead. needs to be scalable to large numbers of nozzles over a large area, and to small feature sizes (small nozzle and heater widths) and thus high cycling frequencies. Should be designed to minimize heat loss from the heating element, and from the combustion in the nozzles, this prevents flame quenching and excessive power consumption as we scale down feature size.","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"assembly/print-head-legacy/#scope","text":"Before you get started you should know that this document is only for the most basic of print heads obtainable with off the shelf parts and materials. This is intended as a very simple first step into the pyrojet project, and towards building your own pyrojet printer. You will require a few basic hand tools, such as a hack saw and precision screw driver. The materials for the print head can be a bit odd to source, such as FR4 plated through hole perf boards on 1.27mm pitch, and the of course the silicon carbide monofilament that is the heating element. Unfortunately, it is one of the vey few materials, commercially available that can do the job and do it well. Other heating element materials, such as graphite, kanthal, nichrome, platinum, stainless steel, generally do not have high enough resistance to attain the thermal ramp speed required of the heating element, and/or lack the oxidation resistance, hot creep strength and high melting point (>3100 K ) required to survive repeated exposure to stoichiometric hydrocarbon combustion and molten metal particles.. If you do find another material better suited and more widely available (some kind of oxygen resistant graphite? maybe tungsten carbide? Zriconia wire? Molybdenum disillicide wire?) do not hesitate to make it known and use it!","title":"Scope"},{"location":"assembly/print-head-legacy/#graphical-assembly-guide","text":"","title":"Graphical Assembly Guide"},{"location":"assembly/print-head-legacy/#step-1-preparing-the-backplane","text":"Cut out a piece of the 2.54mm pitch PCB. You could use a bandsaw, keyhole saw, jewelers saw, or other implements. There are many kinds of perfboard available. Square pads are less common but do exist, and help greatly in alignment in later steps. Mill/saw out a rectangular piece of the 2.54mm perfboard, 11 holes long, by 5 holes wide. Approximately, 29 mm long, by 15 mm wide. Try to keep your cuts as straight as possible. The backplane will have rough edges and may require sanding or lapping. You can use fine grit sand paper and side cutters or a razor blade to trim the rough edges, or simply smooth it down against a piece of ceramic, like aluminum oxide sheets as shown below. Lap the rough cut edges of the back plane to make sure it will fit nicely on the nozzle plate. Be sure to dunk the backplane 99% IPA or a similar cleaning agent to remove dust and oil after lapping. For the next step, grab a fine point sharpie, and 1.27mm pitch perfboard(for nozzle plate), and align the holes in the 2.54mm backplane with holes in the 1.27mm perfboard. Make sure there is some margin in the 1.27mm perfboard around your aligned 2.54mm backplane. Place the freshly cut, lapped and cleaned backplane onto the 1.27mm pitch perfboard, aligning the holes of each board. Mark the position with a fine point sharpie, and mark the location of the heater row on the nozzle plate as well.","title":"Step 1: Preparing the backplane"},{"location":"assembly/print-head-legacy/#step-2-installing-the-heating-element","text":"Once you have the location marked and the backplane aligned and resting on the nozzle plate, get your silicon carbide monofilament of choice. Mine is a specialty materials, SCS-6 standard 0.135mm carbon core 3C, beta silicon carbide CVD derived monofilament. Remove the backplane from the nozzle plate and prepare to align a piece of the filament with the row you marked on the nozzle plate previously to denote where your center row (heater row) is located. Just above where you made your heater row mark, place a piece of Kapton tape, being careful not to cover the row of holes in the 1.27mm perfboard where your heater row goes. Place another piece of Kapton along the bottom edge of the 1.27mm perfboard, just below your heater row mark as shown, to secure the nozzle plate to your work surface and provide alignment of the filament as well as preload between the nozzle plate and the backplane. Lay the silicon carbide monofilament along the heater row as shown, between the pieces of Kapton tape. Secure the filament to the 1.27mm pitch perfboard nozzle plate and across the heater row with Kapton tape, perpendicular to the other two pieces of Kapton as shown.","title":"Step 2: Installing The Heating Element"},{"location":"assembly/print-head-legacy/#step-3-installing-the-backplane-and-clamping-the-heating-element","text":"Find your M1.2X3mm self tapping screws and precision screw driver\u2026 Lay your backplane gently across your now tapped down silicon carbide monofilament heating element, being sure to align every other hole in the nozzle plate, with each hole in the backplane, and extract a M1.2 X 3mm self tapping screw from the box. Firmly press and screw the m1.2 X 3mm screw into one one of the aligned holes, preferable one at the far left corner of the backplane closest to the edge. It should bite and screw in easily. Tighten it until it is firm and snug, and resists further turning. But no tighter. Repeat this fastening process, being careful to stagger the screws and install them adjacent to the heater row, so that no two are on the same column. This will make soldering easier later, and ensures a uniform clamping force on the heating element which provide consistent electrical and thermal contact. Set your multimeter to the 200 Ohm setting, and probe each pair of adjacent contacts along the heater row on the now secured backplane. Go back and tighten the screws until all the heater resistances read between 10 and 100 ohms. If all your screws are tightened evenly, all the resistances should cluster between 20 and 50 ohms. Optimal resistance for the heaters in this design is 22 Ohms.","title":"Step 3: Installing The Backplane And Clamping The Heating Element"},{"location":"assembly/print-head-legacy/#step-4-releasing-the-printhead","text":"You may now use your hack saw, or mill to carefully release the print head assembly from the nozzle plate stock, if you did not cut the nozzle plate out separately\u2026 This will be done by cutting flat through the surface of the 1.27 mm perfboard stock as shown\u2026 Cutting through the 1.27mm perfboard is quite tough. It takes some patience and a sturdy work surface. A clamp or other work piece holder can help, though it is possible to perform the release entirely by hand. You may find that pieces of the nozzle plate stock 1.27mm perfboard break off as you saw through it. Stop once you can see the 2.54 mm perfboard back plane showing. Be sure to leave the 2.54 mm perfboard excess material around the nozzle plate, to use as a flange for later. After perhaps 10 minutes of steady work, you should end up with something like what you see in this image of the released print head. Each active nozzle (every other hole in the 1.27 mm perfboard nozzle plate) is ~0.635 mm in diameter and ~1.6 mm deep. Each is plated with copper and nickel which serves as a thermal barrier coating. Take note of the heater and nozzle locations. Each heater formed by the contacts of the 2.54 mm pitch perfboard pressing against the silicon carbide monofilament, create heaters that are cylindrical and have dimensions of ~0.5mm long X 0.135mm diameter.","title":"Step 4: Releasing The Printhead"},{"location":"assembly/print-head-legacy/#step-5-packaging-and-back-contacts-soldering","text":"Once you have your completed print head chip, and have identified the back contact locations, grab a set of 9, separately colored 0.1\u201d jumper pins, and leave them glued together to make a homemade color coded ribbon cable. Use a pair of needle nose pliers to bend the pins, at one end of your \u201cribbon cable\u201d to 90 degree \u201cL\u201d shapes. Alternatively, you may create solder jumpers across the contacts of the backplane on it's backside. Solder the freshly bent \u201cL\u201d shaped jumper pin ends of the ribbon cable to the back contacts (the 2.54mm pitch perfboard plated holes we identified earlier in slide 27 and 28). This could take some time, it is a tight job, and can be frustrating. Take your time, take breaks and try not to breath too much solder. A fine tip soldering iron, and some fine solder wire helps. When finished your jumpers should have their insulated black thermoplastic end covers inside the perimeter of the print head back plane. Like the image to the right otherwise it may not fit into the reservoir and package very well\u2026 The last step is to coat the edges of the print head chip in a two part epoxy or superglue, and press it into the hole in the bottom of the 3D printed reservoir and creality ender 3 compatible package. Be careful not to get the epoxy up onto the nozzle plate, and try to keep it on the flange of the backplane as much as possible.
