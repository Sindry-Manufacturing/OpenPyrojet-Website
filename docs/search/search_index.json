I do not recommend eating them, but they are essentially sand paper grit / drill bit / sawblade reinforcements. So they are quite safe in any quantity. Pure metals are the biggest real risk to handle and store in general. of the pure metals, zirconium, aluminum, titanium are probably the most reactive and toxic to human health if we are not discussing alkalis. Like lithium, sodium, potassium. Unless you are planning on printing batteries(which you could) we have no business with alkalis generally, due to their toxicity and explosion hazard. Titanium, aluminum, and zirconium are all highly flammable even at relatively large particle sizes, oxidize exothermically in air, and can self ignite when simply sitting on a shelf. They are an explosion hazard and potential neurotoxins when aerosolized(which they do readily due to their low specific density among metals). So under no circumstances should you breath or ingest them! Chrome is poisonous if inhaled and a known carcinogen. So stay away from it if at all possible. Nickel, iron, copper, Zinc, molybdenum, tungsten, and their alloys are generally benign and easy to handle, as long as one does not create dust clouds out of them. Anything containing silicon is relatively harmless, but can become an airborne silicate if it is very fine, which is essentially like inhaling asbestos. So try to stay away from silicon containing alloys. They have a lot of performance benefits for certain applications. and are really not that dangerous, since they tend to be heavy and difficult to aerosolize. But still.

Further notes Our preferred feedstock materials are spherical particles between 1 and 50 microns in diameter. smaller an larger sizes will work to a point, but have a variety of complications around their tendency to settle and clog (for big particles) or to aggregate and clog (for very small particles). Or preferred fuel is either, Ethanol, methanol, naptha(white gas/coleman fuel), or common low octane unleaded gasoline. The reason we like white gas and ethanol best, is thanks to their high energy density, relatively benign combustion products, and fast, clean burning behavior. White gas is easier to ignite and burns hotter, and is easy to store and transport. Ethanol is common and very clean burning, though it has about half the energy density of white gas. So it will make for slower prints for most materials.

By using affordable, accessible and readily available parts and materials, we will create a new breed of 3D printer, that enables the heterogenous additive manufacturing of metal, plastic and ceramic monoliths rapidly, precisely, autonomously and at relatively low cost(in terms of time and money) to the user compared to contemporary 3D printing solutions. Current Market We believe this to be possible, due to the convergence of several co-factors in the present day(2022). In particular, the incredible decline in cost and complexity of autonomous CNC and robotic components, in terms of control and actuation, as well as the wide availability of good quality standard structural elements, the decreasing cost of refractory materials in favorble form factors, the wide availability of energy dense fuel products, and the increasing availability and declining cost of particulate material feedstocks. Additionally, the need for low cost, autonomous and widely accessible electronics prototyping and manufacturing processes, that improve on the user experience and the overall dirty dull and dangerous state of the art in electronics manufacturing are highly desirable to many parties beyond just we the developers. Current 3D printing approaches are largely ineffective in terms of cost and time for generating high quality, looks like, feels like, and works like, electronic parts, we believe this represents a substantial opportunity to create change in electronics manufacturing and prototyping, and eventually in the whole of manufacturing as a concept through the introduction of relatively low cost, autonomous, high speed, high precision 3D printing of metals, plastics and ceramics. We also aim to eventually bring totally custom, free open and autonomous, on demand manufacturing, to the consumer desktop, or at least to the community scale, facilitating a return to the flexible and local cottage industries of the past, now cybernetically enhanced with the ability to create with the speed and quality of autonomous mass production assembly lines, and accelerated by the computerization and networked intelligence of the modern internet. Goal Outline We believe we can accomplish these lofty goals by hybridizing thermal inkjet printing and thermal spray tehnologies into a compact, self contained, open source 3D printer print head assembly and material feedstock handling system integrable with mass market consumer 3D printer control boards and robotic motion systems such as the Ender 3, the Prusa mk3s and mini, and others. How we'll achieve it The basic system concept is thus: Fuel and material are held in a reservoir, kept mixed and pumped in and out by a syringe pump. This pump pushes fuel, and suspended material particles to the print head from the back through perfboard(of which the print head is made) holes. The fuel and material mixture circulate over the top of the print head at a constant average velocity to produce a negative pressure and prevent settling of the materials suspended in the fuel. When the time comes to deposit material on the build plate, a short voltage pulse of controlled amplitude is applied to the captive heater wire, across two adjacent plated through vias in the perfboard. This causes the wire to rapidly(with in 1-10 milliseconds) heat up, vaporizing the fuel and entraining the suspended material. Once an appropriate volume of fuel and material has been vaporized into the nozzle, a second, larger amplitude voltage pulse is applied, raising the temperature in the nozzle to the autoignition temperature of the fuel/air mixture in the nozzle. This ignites the fuel-air mixture, and melts and accelerates the material to deposit it on the build plate. Thusly, can we deposit virtually any material known, heterogeneously, autonomously with nearly complete closed loop control of the mass and energy flows of the process. Control is achieved by continuously performing 3 simultaneous measurement techniques, namely, differential scanning calorimetry(DSC), Surface enhanced IR spectroscopy(IRSPEC), and cyclcic voltammetry(CV). The first technique(DSC) is done by continuously monitoring the relationship between temperature, and power of the heating element throughout the deposition process. By tracking changes in the power applied to the element to maintain a given temperature across the whole temperature ramp during deposition, we can spot phase changes, ignition, deflagration and combustion, and continuously monitor the health and efficiency of the deposition process in each nozzle during each discrete deposition event. The second technique (IRSPEC) is done by continuously monitoring the short time scale photocurrents induced in the element by the emitted and reflected IR-photons(heat related light) from the combustion of the fuel, the melting and cooling of the feed stock material and from the various surfaces effected during deposition. This allows us to monitor the chemical composition of the involved surfaces in real time, and to get a handle on the specific bonding events taking place to allow tuning and monitoring of interface growth and quality during deposition. The third technique(CV) is done by providing a controlled input voltage waveform, and continuously monitoring changes in the response current of the heating element and adjoining electrical contacts. In this way we can detect electrochemical events and manipulate the electrochemistry of the combustion, and gaseous phases in the vicinity of the deposition process, in particular, oxidation events, reduction events, partial combustion, coking, etc.","title":"Project Brief"},{"location":"project-brief/#project-brief","text":"The current objective of OpenPyrojet, is to create the first generation open source and open hardware thermal spraying 3D printer.

Take note of our safety guidelines, but don't consider them comprehensive or complete. This page shows you how the Gen 3.1 print head prototype was assembled. This is what the finished print head looks like: To build a strong print head, multiple layers made from PCBs are used. These layers are stacked in the order as they are laid out below: First, the inlet and outlet are prepared. To connect Viton tubing to the print head, small copper pipes ( 3 mm diameter) are soldered to the PCB. The picture shows a larger copper pipe, because the wrong size was used when taking pictures: Solder was applied to the pads first: Initially, the solder doesn't want to connect neatly all around the copper pipe. The picture below shows the result of that. Some extra solder was used and placed on such locations. Flux would've probably helped too. Smudges are another problem that might occur while soldering. It cleaned it off by wiping the (cleaned) soldering iron on it. It's not problematic if there is some solder on the side, but I have to make sure it's not sharp. That way, it won't cut the Viton tubing later on: Finally, there is a neat collar on the copper pipe: The next step is to put the monofilament on one of the PCB layers. This monofilament is what heats up the fuel, which causes the fuel to eject through the nozzle. The filament gets sandwiched between the nozzle PCB and the PCB that holds the connector. The filament can be stored in a folded sheet of paper: The filament is cut to size. It's good to make it as wide as possible, so it's easier to control and so that we can tape it down on the sides. Combining the PCBs is tricky, because the filament won't lay still on a flat surface. In the picture, glue is used to keep the filament in place. In the future, a piece of tape (e.g. Kapton tape) will be a better alternative. The nozzle PCB layer had holes that were too small in diameter. They were widened them by hand with some cheap drills, slowly increasing the diameter 0.1 mm at a time: A single row of screws combine the two PCB layers. They are not tightened yet: Tightening is done carefully and as evenly as possible. When everything stops sliding around, resistance measurements are done before continueing to tighten further. The resistance measurements are repeated until the values are in an acceptable range. The nozzle plate should be placed straigth, unlike in the picture below. In the future, a 3D printable guide will be developed to combine the 2 PCBs with proper alignment. The prepared PCBs are ready to be combined. I took 8 pieces of M2 x 10mm and some M2 nuts to match. Medium-strength loctite was also used: At this point, I have a finished physical assembly:","title":"Print Head gen 3.1"},{"location":"assembly/print-head-legacy/","text":"Warning This is an experimental hobby project.

Should be cheap, costing less than 2 USD / printhead. needs to be scalable to large numbers of nozzles over a large area, and to small feature sizes (small nozzle and heater widths) and thus high cycling frequencies. Should be designed to minimize heat loss from the heating element, and from the combustion in the nozzles, this prevents flame quenching and excessive power consumption as we scale down feature size. Scope Before you get started you should know that this document is only for the most basic of print heads obtainable with off the shelf parts and materials. This is intended as a very simple first step into the pyrojet project, and towards building your own pyrojet printer. You will require a few basic hand tools, such as a hack saw and precision screw driver. The materials for the print head can be a bit odd to source, such as FR4 plated through hole perf boards on 1.27mm pitch, and the of course the silicon carbide monofilament that is the heating element. Unfortunately, it is one of the vey few materials, commercially available that can do the job and do it well. Other heating element materials, such as graphite, kanthal, nichrome, platinum, stainless steel, generally do not have high enough resistance to attain the thermal ramp speed required of the heating element, and/or lack the oxidation resistance, hot creep strength and high melting point (>3100 K ) required to survive repeated exposure to stoichiometric hydrocarbon combustion and molten metal particles.. If you do find another material better suited and more widely available (some kind of oxygen resistant graphite? maybe tungsten carbide? Zriconia wire? Molybdenum disillicide wire?) do not hesitate to make it known and use it! Graphical Assembly Guide Step 1: Preparing the backplane Cut out a piece of the 2.54mm pitch PCB. You could use a bandsaw, keyhole saw, jewelers saw, or other implements. There are many kinds of perfboard available. Square pads are less common but do exist, and help greatly in alignment in later steps. Mill/saw out a rectangular piece of the 2.54mm perfboard, 11 holes long, by 5 holes wide. Approximately, 29 mm long, by 15 mm wide. Try to keep your cuts as straight as possible. The backplane will have rough edges and may require sanding or lapping. You can use fine grit sand paper and side cutters or a razor blade to trim the rough edges, or simply smooth it down against a piece of ceramic, like aluminum oxide sheets as shown below. Lap the rough cut edges of the back plane to make sure it will fit nicely on the nozzle plate. Be sure to dunk the backplane 99% IPA or a similar cleaning agent to remove dust and oil after lapping. For the next step, grab a fine point sharpie, and 1.27mm pitch perfboard(for nozzle plate), and align the holes in the 2.54mm backplane with holes in the 1.27mm perfboard. Make sure there is some margin in the 1.27mm perfboard around your aligned 2.54mm backplane. Place the freshly cut, lapped and cleaned backplane onto the 1.27mm pitch perfboard, aligning the holes of each board. Mark the position with a fine point sharpie, and mark the location of the heater row on the nozzle plate as well. Step 2: Installing The Heating Element Once you have the location marked and the backplane aligned and resting on the nozzle plate, get your silicon carbide monofilament of choice. Mine is a specialty materials, SCS-6 standard 0.135mm carbon core 3C, beta silicon carbide CVD derived monofilament. Remove the backplane from the nozzle plate and prepare to align a piece of the filament with the row you marked on the nozzle plate previously to denote where your center row (heater row) is located. Just above where you made your heater row mark, place a piece of Kapton tape, being careful not to cover the row of holes in the 1.27mm perfboard where your heater row goes. Place another piece of Kapton along the bottom edge of the 1.27mm perfboard, just below your heater row mark as shown, to secure the nozzle plate to your work surface and provide alignment of the filament as well as preload between the nozzle plate and the backplane. Lay the silicon carbide monofilament along the heater row as shown, between the pieces of Kapton tape. Secure the filament to the 1.27mm pitch perfboard nozzle plate and across the heater row with Kapton tape, perpendicular to the other two pieces of Kapton as shown. Step 3: Installing The Backplane And Clamping The Heating Element Find your M1.2X3mm self tapping screws and precision screw driver\u2026 Lay your backplane gently across your now tapped down silicon carbide monofilament heating element, being sure to align every other hole in the nozzle plate, with each hole in the backplane, and extract a M1.2 X 3mm self tapping screw from the box. Firmly press and screw the m1.2 X 3mm screw into one one of the aligned holes, preferable one at the far left corner of the backplane closest to the edge. It should bite and screw in easily. Tighten it until it is firm and snug, and resists further turning. But no tighter. Repeat this fastening process, being careful to stagger the screws and install them adjacent to the heater row, so that no two are on the same column. This will make soldering easier later, and ensures a uniform clamping force on the heating element which provide consistent electrical and thermal contact. Set your multimeter to the 200 Ohm setting, and probe each pair of adjacent contacts along the heater row on the now secured backplane. Go back and tighten the screws until all the heater resistances read between 10 and 100 ohms. If all your screws are tightened evenly, all the resistances should cluster between 20 and 50 ohms. Optimal resistance for the heaters in this design is 22 Ohms. Step 4: Releasing The Printhead You may now use your hack saw, or mill to carefully release the print head assembly from the nozzle plate stock, if you did not cut the nozzle plate out separately\u2026 This will be done by cutting flat through the surface of the 1.27 mm perfboard stock as shown\u2026 Cutting through the 1.27mm perfboard is quite tough. It takes some patience and a sturdy work surface. A clamp or other work piece holder can help, though it is possible to perform the release entirely by hand. You may find that pieces of the nozzle plate stock 1.27mm perfboard break off as you saw through it. Stop once you can see the 2.54 mm perfboard back plane showing. Be sure to leave the 2.54 mm perfboard excess material around the nozzle plate, to use as a flange for later. After perhaps 10 minutes of steady work, you should end up with something like what you see in this image of the released print head. Each active nozzle (every other hole in the 1.27 mm perfboard nozzle plate) is ~0.635 mm in diameter and ~1.6 mm deep. Each is plated with copper and nickel which serves as a thermal barrier coating. Take note of the heater and nozzle locations. Each heater formed by the contacts of the 2.54 mm pitch perfboard pressing against the silicon carbide monofilament, create heaters that are cylindrical and have dimensions of ~0.5mm long X 0.135mm diameter. Step 5: Packaging and Back Contacts Soldering Once you have your completed print head chip, and have identified the back contact locations, grab a set of 9, separately colored 0.1\u201d jumper pins, and leave them glued together to make a homemade color coded ribbon cable. Use a pair of needle nose pliers to bend the pins, at one end of your \u201cribbon cable\u201d to 90 degree \u201cL\u201d shapes. Alternatively, you may create solder jumpers across the contacts of the backplane on it's backside. Solder the freshly bent \u201cL\u201d shaped jumper pin ends of the ribbon cable to the back contacts (the 2.54mm pitch perfboard plated holes we identified earlier in slide 27 and 28). This could take some time, it is a tight job, and can be frustrating. Take your time, take breaks and try not to breath too much solder. A fine tip soldering iron, and some fine solder wire helps. When finished your jumpers should have their insulated black thermoplastic end covers inside the perimeter of the print head back plane. Like the image to the right otherwise it may not fit into the reservoir and package very well\u2026 The last step is to coat the edges of the print head chip in a two part epoxy or superglue, and press it into the hole in the bottom of the 3D printed reservoir and creality ender 3 compatible package. Be careful not to get the epoxy up onto the nozzle plate, and try to keep it on the flange of the backplane as much as possible. Here are some short clips of the printhead actually firing, fueled by naptha(white gas/coleman gas) and about 23 watts of peak electrical pulse energy , @ 31 Volts, 0.75 A .
