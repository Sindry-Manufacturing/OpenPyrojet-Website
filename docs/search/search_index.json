The specifications of the finished print head are thus: 8 channels, 4 anodes, 4 cathodes heater room temperature resistances(RTR) between 10-100 Ohms, generally clustering around 20-50 ohms Negative temperature coefficient of resistance (NTCR) of ~5.2E-4 Ohm / K maximum pulse energy tolerance of 1.2 joules, maximum drive voltage, 50 Volts, maximum drive current 500 milliamps. Element is intended to ramp from room temperature to 1900 K in <= 10 milliseconds. Heating element material: graphite carbon core Silicon carbide CVD monofilament, 0.135 mm diameter. 0.03mm carbon core diameter. Resistivity of 0.05 Ohm * cm, 2E-4 Ohm * m. Board and manifold material : FR4 glass epoxy prepreg board with copper-nickel plated through holes. Inlet and electrical lead side 2.54 millimeter pitch with 1.2mm diameter holes, 2.0 mm wide square pad contacts concentric to holes. Nozzle plate, round 0.635mm diameter holes on 1.27mm pitch, secured to 2.54 mm pitch board with self tapping m1.2 black oxide screws. Print head must support capacitive touch sensing, temperature monitoring of the heating elements, and IV signal monitoring in the nozzles. Should be cheap, costing less than 2 USD / printhead. needs to be scalable to large numbers of nozzles over a large area, and to small feature sizes (small nozzle and heater widths) and thus high cycling frequencies. Should be designed to minimize heat loss from the heating element, and from the combustion in the nozzles, this prevents flame quenching and excessive power consumption as we scale down feature size. Scope Before you get started you should know that this document is only for the most basic of print heads obtainable with off the shelf parts and materials. This is intended as a very simple first step into the pyrojet project, and towards building your own pyrojet printer. You will require a few basic hand tools, such as a hack saw and precision screw driver. The materials for the print head can be a bit odd to source, such as FR4 plated through hole perf boards on 1.27mm pitch, and the of course the silicon carbide monofilament that is the heating element. Unfortunately, it is one of the vey few materials, commercially available that can do the job and do it well. Other heating element materials, such as graphite, kanthal, nichrome, platinum, stainless steel, generally do not have high enough resistance to attain the thermal ramp speed required of the heating element, and/or lack the oxidation resistance, hot creep strength and high melting point (>3100 K ) required to survive repeated exposure to stoichiometric hydrocarbon combustion and molten metal particles.. If you do find another material better suited and more widely available (some kind of oxygen resistant graphite? maybe tungsten carbide? Zriconia wire? Molybdenum disillicide wire?) do not hesitate to make it known and use it!

FAILURE TO DO SO WILL LIKELY RESULT IN DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH! Before you begin The carbides, nitrides and oxides are generally quite benign and inert even as micron powders. I do not recommend eating them, but they are essentially sand paper grit / drill bit / sawblade reinforcements. So they are quite safe in any quantity. Pure metals are the biggest real risk to handle and store in general. of the pure metals, zirconium, aluminum, titanium are probably the most reactive and toxic to human health if we are not discussing alkalis. Like lithium, sodium, potassium. Unless you are planning on printing batteries(which you could) we have no business with alkalis generally, due to their toxicity and explosion hazard. Titanium, aluminum, and zirconium are all highly flammable even at relatively large particle sizes, oxidize exothermically in air, and can self ignite when simply sitting on a shelf. They are an explosion hazard and potential neurotoxins when aerosolized(which they do readily due to their low specific density among metals). So under no circumstances should you breath or ingest them! Chrome is poisonous if inhaled and a known carcinogen. So stay away from it is at all possible. Nickel, iron, copper, Zinc, molybdenum, tungsten, and their alloys are generally benign and easy to handle, as long as one does not create dust clouds out of them. Anything containing silicon is relatively harmless, but can become an airborne silicate if it is very fine, which is essentially like inhaling asbestos. So try to stay away from silicon containing alloys. They have a lot of performance benefits for certain applications. and are really not that dangerous, since they tend to be heavy and difficult to aerosolize. But still. Best not to tango with them if you dont have to. DO NOT mess with beryllium or beryllia containing compounds unless you have no other choices. They are quite poisonous and can cause berylliosis, which makes mesothelioma look like a joke. Mercury is probably not available, but if it is, do not mess with it. It and its fumes (easily produced when it boils in a flame) will make you insane and kill you painfully. Zirconium, titanium and aluminum can be worked with, BUT they require significant care in handling. And splitting kilograms into gram quantities is probably not a safe thing to do without proper dust handling gear, a good respirator(effective for your specific particle size!), gloves, goggles(full face mask if possible) a smock, apron or lab coat rated for flame resistance, with tightly woven pores to resist infiltration and a shop equipped to deal with flammable metal powders(fume extractors, dust filters cyclonic collectors, zero spark low heat motors,anti static work surfaces and tubing etc. Basically everything required for working with gunpowder, solid rocket fuels or other hazardous materials). In general, unless it is absolutely necessary we prefer to try to derive the more reactive metals from their oxide counterparts, because their oxides are relatively benign, and can be converted to their pure metals via a reducing flame chemistry in the print head. (a fuel rich combustion mixture of air and fuel) This simple change of approach can eliminate a lot of cost and trouble in dealing with explosive powders. Basically all super alloys are relatively inert and safe to handle. Inconel, zirconel, Stellite, hastealloy, monel, tribaloy, nichrome, kanthal, etc. Are all pretty benign and dense, so they do not aerosolize easily and have few biological effects besides typical metal fever from inhalation(dont breathe it!). Not fun, and not recommended but not particularly deadly or long lasting. The probable (at the time of writing) lowest cost and lowest risk pure metal feedstocks are Iron, nickel, copper, molybdenum, and tungsten. virtually any oxide or carbide is easy to acquire and safe to handle. Most plastics are safe as well to handle as powders though they still can pose a dust explosion hazard is aerosolized as most powders do. In short DO NOT AEROSOLIZE THE POWDERS OUTSIDE OF THE PRINT HEAD! They should be pretty affordable(10-100 USD per kilogram), and allow us to do a variety of useful things, like making alloys, strong mechanical parts, and electronics. Additionally, noble metals, though very expensive, make for great feed stocks. Silver, gold and platinum are the \"gold standard\" for making dense, pure electrically conductive metal parts and tracks for electronic devices. They are also relatively benign, bioinert and non explosive thanks to their resistance to oxidation. Though their nanoparticle varieties can interact with one's genes in undesirable ways. DONT EAT THESE! Fuels Viable fuels for pyrojet can be just about any combustible substance than can flow through the print head. This includes generally, ethanol, Acetone, IPA, glycerol, gasoline, methanol, Nitromethane, paraffin, PLA, ABS, ASA, naptha, hexane, decane, motor and gear oil, WD-40,Kerosene, virtually any long chain hydrocarbon, combustible alcohol, alkene, alkane, or other fuel. These fuels are COMBUSTIBLE, and FLAMMABLE, this means that they can EXPLODE and seriously injure or kill the unwary, unwitting or fool hardy who disrespect or misuse them. DO NOT UNDERSTIMATE THE DANGER OF THESE FUELS. It only takes a second for an accident to become a fuel air bomb, or a high explosive. DONT BECOME A STATISTIC BECAUSE YOU DID NOT READ AND FOLLOW APPROPRIATE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS. MANY FUELS RELEASE NOXIOUS BYPRODUCTS like acrolein, acetylaldehyde, formaldehyde, nitrc acid, CO and CO2, WHEN COMBUSTED AND CONSUME OXYGEN, THIS MAKES THEM A HEALTH HAZARD WHEN BURNED IN A CLOSED SPACE AND CAN SUFFOCATE YOU BY CONSUMING ALL THE OXYGEN IN YOUR WORK SPACE! ENSURE ADEQUTE VENTILATION AND KEEP A FIRE EXTINGUISHER FIRE BLANKETS AND KAOLITE HANDY. BE SURE TO KNOW YOUR ESCAPE ROUTES AND TAKE STOCK OF POTENTIAL CONSEQEUNCES IF THINGS GO BAD AND GET OUT OF HAND. WHILE WE HAVE TAKEN EVERY EFFORT TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THE OPERATOR IN THE DESIGN OF THE PRINTER THE GREATEST BARRIER TO DISASTER IS YOU AND YOUR PREPAREDNESS AND CONTINUAL OBSERVANCE OF ALL NECESSARY PRECAUTION WHEN OPERATING THE PYROJET DEVICE! Further notes Our preferred feedstock materials are spherical particles between 1 and 50 microns in diameter. smaller an larger sizes will work to a point, but have a variety of complications around their tendency to settle and clog (for big particles) or to aggregate and clog (for very small particles). Or preferred fuel is either, Ethanol, methanol, naptha(white gas/coleman fuel), or common low octane unleaded gasoline. The reason we like white gas and ethanol best, is thanks to their high energy density, relatively benign combustion products, and fast, clean burning behavior. White gas is easier to ignite and burns hotter, and is easy to store and transport. Ethanol is common and very clean burning, though it has about half the energy density of white gas. So it will make for slower prints for most materials.

By using affordable, accessible and readily available parts and materials, we will create a new breed of 3D printer, that enables the heterogenous additive manufacturing of metal, plastic and ceramic monoliths rapidly, precisely, autonomously and at relatively low cost(in terms of time and money) to the user compared to contemporary 3D printing solutions. Current Market We believe this to be possible, due to the convergence of several co-factors in the present day(2022). In particular, the incredible decline in cost and complexity of autonomous CNC and robotic components, in terms of control and actuation, as well as the wide availability of good quality standard structural elements, the decreasing cost of refractory materials in favorble form factors, the wide availability of energy dense fuel products, and the increasing availability and declining cost of particulate material feedstocks. Additionally, the need for low cost, autonomous and widely accessible electronics prototyping and manufacturing processes, that improve on the user experience and the overall dirty dull and dangerous state of the art in electronics manufacturing are highly desirable to many parties beyond just we the developers. Current 3D printing approaches are largely ineffective in terms of cost and time for generating high quality, looks like, feels like, and works like, electronic parts, we believe this represetns a substantial opportunity to create change in electronics manufacturing and prototyping, and eventually in the whole of manufacturing as a concept through the introduction of relatively low cost, autonomous, high speed, high precision 3D printing of metals, plastics and ceramics. We also aim to eventually bring totally custom, free open and autonomous, on demand manufacturing, to the consumer desktop, or at least to the community scale, facilitating a return to the flexible and local cottage industries of the past, now cybernetically enhanced with the ability to create with the speed and quality of autonomous mass production assembly lines, and accelerated by the computerization and networked intelligence of the modern internet. Goal Outline We believe we can accomplish these lofty goals by hybridizing thermal inkjet printing and thermal spray tehnologies into a compact, self contained, open source 3D printer print head assembly and material feedstock handling system integrable with mass market consumer 3D printer control boards and robotic motion systems such as the Ender 3, the Prusa mk3s and mini, and others. How we'll achieve it The basic system concept is thus: Fuel and material are held in a reservoir, kept mixed and pumped in and out by a syringe pump. This pump pushes fuel, and suspended material particles to the print head from the back through perfboard(of which the print head is made) holes. The fuel and material mixture circulate over the top of the print head at a constant average velocity to produce a negative pressure and prevent settling of the materials suspended in the fuel. When the time comes to deposit material on the build plate, a short voltage pulse of controlled amplitude is applied to the captive heater wire, across two adjacent plated through vias in the perfboard. This causes the wire to rapidly(with in 1-10 milliseconds) heat up, vaporizing the fuel and entraining the suspended material. Once an appropriate volume of fuel and material has been vaporized into the nozzle, a second, larger amplitude voltage pulse is applied, raising the temperature in the nozzle to the autoignition temperature of the fuel/air mixture in the nozzle. This ignites the fuel-air mixture, and melts and accelerates the material to deposit it on the build plate. Thusly, can we deposit virtually any material known, heterogenously, autuonomously with nearly complete closed loop control of the mass and energy flows of the process. Control is achieved by continuously performing 3 simultaneous measurement techniques, namely, differential scanning calorimetry(DSC), Surface enhanced IR spectroscopy(IRSPEC), and cyclcic voltammetry(CV). The first technique(DSC) is done by continuously monitoring the relationship between temperature, and power of the heating element throughout the deposition process. By tracking changes in the power applied to the element to maintain a given temperature across the whole temperature ramp during deposition, we can spot phase changes, ignition, deflagration and combustion, and continuously monitor the health and efficiency of the deposition proces in each nozzle during each discrete deposition event. The second technique (IRSPEC) is done by continuously monitoring the short time scale photocurrents induced in the element by the emitted and reflected ir-photons fromthe combustion ofthe fuel, the melting and cooling of the feed stock material and from te various surfaces effected during deposition. This allows us to monitor the chemical composition of the involved surfaces in real time, and to get a handle on the specic bonding events taking place to allow tunig and monitoring of interface growth and quality during deposition. The third technique(CV) is done by providing a controlled input voltage waveform, and continuously monitoring changes in the response current of the heating element and adjoining electrical contacts. In this way we can detect electrochemical events and manipulate the electrochemistry of the combustion, and gaseous phases in the vicinity of the deposition process, in particular, oxidation events, reduction events, partial combustion, coking, etc.","title":"Project Brief"},{"location":"project-brief/#project-brief","text":"The current objective of OpenPyrojet, is to create the first generation Open source and open hardware thermal spraying 3D printer.

This allows us to monitor the chemical composition of the involved surfaces in real time, and to get a handle on the specic bonding events taking place to allow tunig and monitoring of interface growth and quality during deposition. The third technique(CV) is done by providing a controlled input voltage waveform, and continuously monitoring changes in the response current of the heating element and adjoining electrical contacts. In this way we can detect electrochemical events and manipulate the electrochemistry of the combustion, and gaseous phases in the vicinity of the deposition process, in particular, oxidation events, reduction events, partial combustion, coking, etc.","title":"How we'll achieve it"},{"location":"roadmap/","text":"Roadmap and vision The ultimate goal is to create the first generation of universal fabricator.
