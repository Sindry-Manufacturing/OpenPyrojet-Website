# Introduction

OpenPyrojet is an FDM 3D printer technology based on [thermal spraying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_spraying), and more specifically small scale [detonation spraying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detonation_spraying). The feedstock is a mix of micrometer-sized particles (e.g. metals) with a fuel source like naphta. The fuel ignites by heating a filament wire and is then shot through a nozzle on a substrate.
