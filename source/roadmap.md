# Roadmap and vision

The ultimate goal is to create the first generation of universal fabricator.
We believe we can achieve this eventually by breaking this up into smaller goals:

1. Create a prototype [detonation spraying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detonation_spraying) hotend (achieved)
2. Reliably spraying metallic particles on a substrate  (work in progress)
3. Creating a solid layer of a metallic material on a substrate. The end product that proves this goal is a single layer PCB.
4. Creating multi-material objects. We hope to print simple semi-conductors as proof that we reached this goal.
5. TBD
